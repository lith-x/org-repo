assumptions:
there is going to be a bijective relationship between footnotes
and links to said footnotes

user flow:
- add footnote block
- add footnote to said block (array block)
- add inline link to footnote

example:

This is some sample text.[^1]

[^1] This is an associated footnote


footnote feature is basically same as ordered list, except everything
is prepended with [^#] where # is 1-indexed.

by default, typing [^#] will automatically link to the relevant footnote
via some unique id, that will change



id the footnotes and the footnote links, use href="#id" jumps
